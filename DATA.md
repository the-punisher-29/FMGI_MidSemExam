## ðŸ”¹ Primary Paper
I based part of my methodology and context on the following work:

- **SED: A Simple Encoder-Decoder for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation**  
  [ðŸ“„ Paper Link (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.15537)  
  Official Repository: [SED GitHub](https://github.com/xb534/SED)

## ðŸ”¹ Related Repositories
In addition to SED, I also referred to the following repository for comparative insights and dataset handling:

- [CAT-Seg (cvlab-kaist)](https://github.com/cvlab-kaist/CAT-Seg)

## ðŸ”¹ New Dataset (for Q4 Experiments)
For experiments on new data, I used the following dataset:

- **Assisted Video Object Labeling by Joint Tracking of Regions and Keypoints**  
  - *Authors:* Julien Fauqueur, Gabriel Brostow, Roberto Cipolla  
  - *Conference:* IEEE ICCVâ€™07 â€“ Interactive Computer Vision Workshop, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, October 2007.  
  - ðŸ“„ Citation (please use if you build on this dataset):

## ðŸ”¹ License & Usage Notes
- I followed the licenses of the original repositories ([SED](https://github.com/xb534/SED), [CAT-Seg](https://github.com/cvlab-kaist/CAT-Seg)) for usage.  
- I used the ICCVâ€™07 dataset strictly under its academic license conditions.  
- I do **not redistribute** datasets or model weights here. Instead, I provide references and official links so that others can download from the original sources.
